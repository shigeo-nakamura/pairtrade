# Arcus Spot inventory runtime

The Arcus Spot path is intentionally separate from the leveraged BTC/ETH
engine. Base builds consume schema-v3 public recorder snapshots and expose two
non-live modes:

- read_only emits a would-rotate plan and never changes inventory;
- replay_simulation applies the recorded indicative route only to isolated
  in-memory inventory.

The `arcus-spot-live` compile-time feature adds an explicitly gated `live`
mode plus execution safety primitives. It is not enabled by any binary or
service: live mode still emits `would_rotate`, and inventory changes only when
a caller supplies an exactly balance-reconciled confirmed fill. Default and
`arcus-spot-sdk` builds retain no signer or submit surface.

## Safety gates

Before a plan is emitted, the runtime verifies the chain, verified token and
contract identity, exact pair/notional row, both direct routes, matching
reference prices, route age, recommended venue amounts, and recorder schema.
It then enforces:

- a hard floor for each token;
- a per-rotation fraction of inventory above the floor;
- a maximum post-rotation USD inventory imbalance;
- optimistic round-trip loss plus explicit gas and settlement buffers;
- sticky daily and cumulative mark-to-market loss halts;
- maximum hold and mean-reversion exit behavior.

The log-price ratio signal is evaluated against prior samples only. The current
sample is appended after z-score calculation, avoiding same-tick look-ahead.
This is a runtime/replay seam, not evidence that NVDA/AMD is economically
qualified.

## Authenticated execution foundation

With `arcus-spot-live`, the library provides:

- a dedicated asymmetric AWS KMS signer restricted to EIP-712 typed data;
- direct Arcus routing only with `allowWrapped=false`;
- exact-value EIP-2612 authorization when the existing Permit2 allowance is
  insufficient, and refusal of an allowance larger than the exact sell amount;
- independent chain, wallet balance, gas, inventory-floor, token, spender,
  amount, deadline, and signer recovery checks;
- an atomic mode-0600 execution ledger with a pre-POST dispatch marker;
- a disabled library coordinator that connects fresh quote, chain preflight,
  signing, one-shot submit, status polling, and balance reconciliation;
- hard coordinator caps of at most 60-second-old plans, 100 bps slippage, ten
  reconciled swaps per UTC day, and deployer-pinned raw sell maxima;
- exactly one submit attempt, sticky `UNKNOWN` on ambiguous delivery, safe
  status GETs, and exact pre/post wallet-balance reconciliation;
- a runtime commit seam that refuses fills inconsistent with the genuine
  strategy plan.

The components intentionally do not form an enabled daemon yet. No KMS key is
created, no wallet is funded, and no message or transaction is signed by adding
this feature. The first real signature remains blocked on the exact one-swap
approval in bot-strategy #772.

Validate the gated foundation without network or wallet access:

    cargo test --lib --no-default-features --features arcus-spot-live arcus_spot

## Deterministic replay

Build with the pinned Arcus connector feature and replay the recorder archive:

    cargo run --no-default-features --features arcus-spot-sdk \
      --bin arcus-spot-runtime -- \
      configs/pairtrade/arcus-spot-runtime.example.yaml \
      /path/to/samples.jsonl \
      /tmp/arcus-events.jsonl

The optional third argument is the event JSONL path. Without it, events go to
stdout. A compact final state summary goes to stderr. Replay evaluates quote
freshness at each snapshot event timestamp, never at the current wall clock.
A future read-only daemon must call step_at with the current UTC time.

The example config remains read-only and is not wired to systemd or deployment.
Provisioning custody, enabling a service, or permitting a signed swap remains
blocked on bot-strategy #772 and fresh approval of the exact wallet, pair,
amount, gas budget, floors, and maximum accepted loss.
